This is a very simple machine learning model web application. The app takes in 5 features about a room and outputs whether or not the room is occupied. The application will eventually be containerized and deployed.

## How to run locally on your machine
# Run the server
1. Create a virtual environment using venv or conda.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application
`python app.py`

Note: There is not extensive error checking on REST calls and inputs: this is a very simple application to be used as a starting point for creating a full stack machine learning model web application.
